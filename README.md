# AI-ChatBot-Simulation
This project simulates an intelligent chatbot that learns and provides tailored responses. Using inheritance and polymorphism, it manages general and specialized queries through classes like Bot and SubjectBot. It dynamically learns via user input, storing query-response pairs in responses.txt, ensuring continuous improvement.

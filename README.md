# AI-ChatBot-Simulation
This project simulates an intelligent chatbot capable of learning and providing tailored responses to user queries. 
It uses inheritance and polymorphism to define a base Bot class for handling general queries and derived classes like GeneralBot and SubjectBot for 
specialized topics. 
The chatbot dynamically learns new query-response pairs through user interaction, storing them in a file (responses.txt) for future use. 
Polymorphism enables unique response generation based on query types. 
File handling ensures the chatbot's knowledge base grows over time, improving its usability.
